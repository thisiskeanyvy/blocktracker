# BlockTracker
A tool to go up the transaction tree of an address on the Blockchain.

## What is BlockTracker?

BlockTracker is a tool for tracking transactions from wallet addresses on the Blockchain. It is able to list them and establish a transaction tree.

Even after mixing funds from one or more wallets, it is able to trace the transactions back to the final wallet address.

### How does it work?

Developed in the Python language, the tool uses the argparse library to handle command line commands. It uses the requests library to retrieve data from multiple API's via a GET method and then sorts it.

To trace a fund mix, the tool builds a transaction tree and also analyses the addresses of the recipients. Once the transaction tree is established, it determines with probabilities the possible final address(es).

  - Argparse (libraries)
  - Requests (libraries)
- Pip >= 3

### Using the command line software :

#List the commands that can be used

```shell
$ python3 blocktracker.py -h #--help
```

```shell
usage: blocktracker.py [-h] [-w WHATADDRESS] [-t TRACK]

optional arguments:
-h, --help       show this help message and exit
-w WHATADDRESS, --whataddress WHATADDRESS
Get type of wallet address
-t TRACK, --track TRACK
Get all transactions from an address
```

#Know the type of crypto-currency in the wallet

```shell
$ python3 blocktracker.py -w TScgcMteFMiYzXMgWPoKkaTNnKaLWZnnPb #--whataddress
```

```shell
TRON (TRX)
```

#Get the transaction tree of one or more addresses of a wallet

```shell
$ python3 blocktracker.py -t 0xbaf681271070c832DbB217665ACf0005f0A87A0c #--track
```

```shell
